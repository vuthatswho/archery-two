      Point Archery is an indoor training facility with  28 shooting (14 -  10 yard lanes and 14 – 20 yard lanes)
      and 2 private coaching rooms. We also have access to 26  additional  20 yard lanes  and an outdoor shooting
      field.  We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first time archer to the professional
